It can be for various reasons. For example, you may want to know if a new user registered, or if a critical business action occurs, such as a user adding an item to their shopping basket. This tutorial outlines a simple way to achieve this using [Emitbase](https://github.com/emitbase/emitbase-core) (an open-source alert platform for developers).\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\n- [Node.js 18.12](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.12.0) or later.\\n- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your machine.\\n- Installed [Emitbase CLI](https://emitbase.github.io/emitbase-website/docs/getting-started#start-with-emitbase-cli).\\n\\n## Supabase Table and the Requirements for Alerts\\n\\nFor the sake of simplicity, I have a basic table named `buyers` with the following columns:\\n\\n- `id` (the table\'s identifier)\\n- `created_at` (the registration time of the user)\\n- `updated_at` (the time of the user\'s last update)\\n- `name` (the buyer\'s name)\\n- `approved` (a flag indicating if a user has been approved by an admin and can log into the application)\\n\\n![Example of Supabase table](./supabase-table.png)\\n\\nI want to receive a Slack message when the following events occur:\\n\\n1. A new buyer registers within the last five minutes.\\n2. The \'buyers\' table contains any rows where the \'approved\' column has a \'FALSE\' value.\\n\\n## Step 1: Create a New Emitbase Project\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npx emitbase init <your-project-name>\\n```\\n\\n## Step 2: Set Up Your `profiles.yml`\\n\\nFirst, create a credentials file:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ touch profiles.yml\\n```\\n\\nIn the `profiles.yml` file, please define your credentials:\\n\\n```bash\\nemitbase:\\n  databases:\\n    dev:\\n      host: <database-host>\\n      database: <database-name>\\n      port: <database-port>\\n      user: <database-username>\\n      password: <database-password>\\n\\n  notifications:\\n    dev:\\n      slack:\\n        port: <slack-port>\\n        channel: <slack-channel>\\n        signingSecret: <slack-signing-secret>\\n        token: <slack-token>\\n\\n  target: dev\\n```\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nCheck the [Integration with Slack](https://emitbase.github.io/emitbase-website/docs/guides/integration-with-slack) documentation page for more information about Slack credentials.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Step 3: Create Necessary Thresholds for Alerts\\n\\nThe first threshold must track whether a new buyer has registered within the last five minutes:\\n\\n```yaml\\nnew_users:\\n  expression: SELECT * FROM buyers WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL \'5 minutes\'\\n  cron: \'* * * * *\'\\n```\\n\\nThe second threshold must track whether the \'buyer\' table contains any rows where the `approved` value is `FALSE`.\\n\\n```yaml\\nunapproved_users:\\n  expression: \'SELECT * FROM buyers WHERE approved = FALSE\'\\n  cron: \'* * * * *\'\\n```\\n\\n## Step 4: Create Alerts Messages\\n\\nFor new users:\\n\\n```yaml\\nnew_users:\\n  slack:\\n    message: \'You have new users who have registered on the platform! \ud83d\ude80\'\\n```\\n\\nFor unapproved rows:\\n\\n```yaml\\nunapproved_users:\\n  slack:\\n    message: \'\ud83d\udce3 We have some unapproved users! Take a look!\'\\n```\\n\\n## Step 5: Build and Run Emitbase\\n\\nTo run the project, it is necessary to build a Docker image:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ docker build -t emitbase .\\n```\\n\\nThen, you can just run it and wait for notification on your slack! \ud83c\udf89\\n\\n```bash\\n$ docker run -it emitbase\\n```\\n\\n## Showcase\\n\\nThe following images show messages in Slack. It\'s really simple; you can set up your alerts in minutes!\\n\\n![Example of Slack messages from Emitbase](./slack-messages.png)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nFor more information, please refer to the entire [Emitbase documentation](https://emitbase.github.io/emitbase-website/docs/introduction).

It didn\'t come out of nowhere; it originated while I was building my last product. I needed a tool that wouldn\'t interfere with my business logic but would act as a straightforward layer directly above the database, allowing me to define alerting logic. Emitbase is exactly it.\\n\\n## Eager for Feedback\\n\\nI want to continue with development, but not everything I think is good is actually good. I am launching it with this piece of information in my mind, and I am super eager to receive feedback from the community!
